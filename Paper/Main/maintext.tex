	% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
	% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
	% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
	% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
	% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
	% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
	% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
	% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
	% suppress numbering.
	
	Intro here
	
	\section*{The Adaptive Particle Representation}
	We illustrate the ideas and concepts behind the APR using a $1D$ Gaussian function as a didactic example. All of the concepts introduced extend to higher dimensions and to general continuous functions, as shown in the Supplement.
